I always think column based naming schemes for grids are weird.

I don't like it when my class names lie to me.

Let's take the well known classname span12 as an example.

It implies that it spans 12 columns.

But what happens at mobile? Do you have a 12 column grid at mobile?

No you don't. That span12 becomes one column.

And this makes me feel :|

This is why namespaced classes that target specific breakpoints are something I am a big fan of.
They can help tell you what something does explicitly.

Instead of span12. What about wi-100. Width 100%. That is true. No matter how many columns you have in your grid.
