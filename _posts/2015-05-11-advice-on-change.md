title: "The Best Advice on Changing Things"

As an athlete in college I got many great pieces of life advice from my
coaches. One of those pieces of advice has significantly shaped how I think
about influencing change to both design and development practices of people I
work with.

My junior year, the cross-country team got a new coach. A few weeks went by and
I was confused as to why we weren’t doing several things I understood to be
best practices. Things I knew he was doing at his last coaching gig.

“Coach wouldn’t it be better if we did x”

“Absolutely Adam. Absolutely.”

“So why aren’t we doing x?”

He sat and thought about it for a second.

“Adam. Runners are fickle creatures. They’ve been doing things a certain way
for a long time and they attribute a lot of their success to their current
  habits. Even if some of those habits aren’t the best.

If I tried to walk in here on day one and change everything - I’d lose a lot of
people. It would be too much change too soon. And we need these people if we’re
going to be a successful team.

If you ever try to change a group of people and their habits - to  do something
great, it will probably take about 3 years. You introduce small changes, you
introduce them slowly. Eventually you’ll get there. It’s not a light switch you
can just flip and have everything fixed overnight. If you try to make it that
way, you’ll fail every single time.”

Three years after he gave me this advice, the Women’s team won their first
conference title. They have won every single conference title since and are now
ranked in the top 10 nationally.
