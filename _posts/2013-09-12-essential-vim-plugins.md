As a front-end developer I've found these plugins to be quite wonderful for editing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While
I'm comfortable running stock vim, I prefer to have these plugins installed as a part of my setup.

I do not have a strong preference between pathogen and vundle for package management.
I have used both - but am currently using
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim "Vundle - vim package manager")

# The List

[Ag](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim "Ag.vim - Plugin for the silver searcher") <br>
My most invaluable plugin. Speeds up my ability to search for strings in both code and filenames then
step through results from my query. 

[Gundo](https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim/ "Gundo - Visualize your history")<br>
Vim indexes your text-editing history in extremely powerful ways. 
But a tree of changes with many branches can be a tough thing to visualize in your head.
This plugin exposes just how powerful vim's history is.

[Ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/ "ctrlp - fuzzy finder")<br>
Fuzzy find files quickly and easily

[Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive "Fugitive - a Git wrapper for Vim")<br>
Fugitive is a wrapper for git commands. It allows you to have a more efficient git workflow
without ever leaving the comforts of vim.

[Snipmate-plus](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate "Snippets for Vim")<br>
Save custom snippets on a per file-type basis. Modeled after snippets in textmate.

[Html5.vim](https://github.com/othree/html5.vim "Syntax highlighting for html5")<br>
Syntax highlighting for new HTML5 elements.

[Scss-syntax.vim](https://github.com/cakebaker/scss-syntax.vim)<br>
Syntax highlighting for sass.

[Vim-css3-syntax](https://github.com/hail2u/vim-css3-syntax)<br>
Syntax highlighting for css3

[Vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax)<br>
Syntax highlighting for javascript


## Extras

I don't currently use these plugins but have found them useful at times.
Note that syntastic can choke a bit if you are editing extremely large files. 

[Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic "Syntastic")<br>
[Lint](https://github.com/joestelmach/lint.vim "Lint")<br>
[Sparkup](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup "Sparkup")<br>
[Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround "Surround")<br>
