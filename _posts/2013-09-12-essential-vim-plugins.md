As a front-end developer I've found these plug-ins to be quite wonderful for editing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While
I'm comfortable running stock - I prefer to have these as a part of my setup.

[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/ "Pathogen - Manage your vim plugins")
By default, vims plugin management isn't the best. I use pathogen to install plugins. To set pathogen up - copy this
script and paste it into your terminal.

```
   mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle; \
   curl -Sso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim \
   https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim
```
