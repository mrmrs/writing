  There are a lot of different ways to get better at writing CSS.
  These are a few of the tips I've picked up that have helped me out along the way.
  Some of them might work, some of them might not.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Learn HTML</h1>
<p>
  CSS just modifies HTML. If you learn how HTML works by default - it will help
  you write better CSS. I learned HTML by reading the spec, and writing lots of
  unstyled HTML.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Study typography</h1>
<p>
  The web is largely text. People have been studying what makes things readable
  (as well as what gets in the way of readability) for hundreds of years.  By
  learning the basics of typography - you'll have a better idea of how to use
  CSS to make interfaces easier to digest for your users.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Talk to people</h1>
<p>
  It doesn't need to be coffee, but talk to people! IF you work with people who
  write CSS, ask them what works for them. More importantly - ask them what
  doesn't work for them. Learning about peoples problems will help you solve
  problems better later on. Find css authors online that you respect and ask them to
  coffee, or if you aren't around them geographically - ask them questions over
  email. Maybe ask if they have time to do a video hangout over coffee. Some of the most
  impactful things I have learned have been because I met up with someone in
  real life and was privileged to ask them questions about their approach and
  just what they are up to. Asking <a href="http://twitter.com/dam">@dam </a>
  out for coffee one day was one of the most impactful things I did to push my
  own development knowledge forward. I also met a rad person that I enjoy
  talking to about life. Not everything is about code. CSS can just
  be a vessel for meeting rad people. But also respect people's privacy. Just
  because they contribute to open source projects doesn't mean they owe you their time.
  Don't be afraid to ask - but be respectful if you don't get a response.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Write a lot of CSS. Make a ton of mistakes.</h1>
<p>
  One of the best ways to learn how to not make mistakes is to make a ton of
  mistakes.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Think critically</h1>
<p>
  Learning doesn't happen by accident. Some people author css for years and
  don't get much better at it.  It's not enough to just practice passively. I
  think practicing with intent is a much more efficient way to get better.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Read a lot of code</h1>
<p>
  All CSS for websites you have access to is open source by default.  This is
  pretty rad for a few reasons. One being that you can unminify the code, read
  it, and learn a lot of things.  There are also a lot of open source css
  projects written by people who spend a lot of time thinking about css.
</p>
<h2 class="f4">Read about how people write code that is not CSS</h1>
<p>
  Authoring CSS is a lot different than programming. There is still a lot to be
  gleamed from reading about the learnings of great programmers. Try on all the
  shoes.  Throw away the ones that don't fit, and keep the ones that do.  If
  you don't know what to read - I suggest checking out my
