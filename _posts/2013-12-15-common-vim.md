### c

c stands for "change" will not do anything on its on, but acts as a modifier to other commands. Here are some common commands handy for editing front end code

```cw``` cw stands for change word. This will delete the word your cursor is over and enter into insert mode

```ci(``` Change all text in between a set of parenthesis.

```ci"``` If your cursor is in between a set of quotes, this will delete everything inside those quotes and drop you into insert mode.

Same as ```d$```

```dw``` Delete the word your cursor is on. Difference between this and cw is that you do not enter into insert mode.

```2dw``` This will delete the word your cursor is on as well as the next one. You can replace 2 with any number.

```2df"``` Delete from cursor to the 2nd quote mark. This is inclusive so it will delete the second quote. This is a handy command for deleting attributes in html if your cursor is on the first letter of the attribute.

### f

f is for finding things so it doesn't do anything on it's own. It will jump to the next character you type after f. It can be combined with c,d,y to change, cut, and copy sections of text.

```fr``` jumps to the next r on the (same line only)
```ft``` jumps to the next t on the (same line only)

```8k``` moves cursor up 8 lines

```<C-w>K``` rotates window to horizontal split

```dk``` delete line above cursor

### l

```l``` Move cursor right one character

```dl``` Delete character under cursor. Same as x.

```L``` Move cursor to last line in window

### m

m is for marking spots (which you can think of as bookmarks in your files). It does not do anything by itself.

```mk``` mark spot as k.

```'k``` return the cursor to the spot you marked as "k"

```d'k``` delete from the cursor's position to the spot you marked as "k"

```c'k``` change from the cursor's position to the spot you marked as "k"

### o

```o``` Opens a new line below where your cursor is and places you in insert mode

```O``` Opens a new line above where your cursor is and places you in insert mode

```CTRL-o``` Go backwards in the jumplist (list of where your cursor has been). Trust me this is like movement steroids.

```12CTRL-o``` You can also pass it a count so this will go backwards in the jumplist 12 spots

### p

Paste is a pretty big deal when you are dealing with code. So p should be one of your best friends.

```p``` pastes in the last thing you yanked or deleted (copied or cut) after the cursor.

```P``` pastes in the last thing you yanked or deleted (copied or cut) before the cursor.

```2p``` pastes in the last thing you yanked or deleted (copied or cut) twice.

```xp``` this will swap two characters. Technically it just deletes the character under your cursor, then pastes it back in. This is the equivalent of ```dlp```

```"*p``` Pastes in text from your system clipboard>

```"2p``` This will paste in text from the second register. You will use this all of the time. Most useful when you delete something you want to paste, then delete something else. Move to the place where you want to paste text, hit p and go "doh". Just remember ```"2p```


```"%p``` Pastes in the name of the current file.

```:212pu``` Pastes in last copy or delete on line 212. 212 can be any line number.

```:42pu *``` Pastes in system clipboard text at line 42.

```"/p``` Pastes in your last search pattern

```:<c-r>/``` Pastes in your last search pattern when you are on the command line

```"ap``` Pastes in the contents of register a. To see a list of registers and what they have in them, do ```:reg``` or ```:registers```

```"= 8*8<CR>p``` Pastes in evaluation of the expression ```8*8```. This could be any maths you want. ```=``` is the expression register, which allows you to do calculations.
From normal mode you can launch it by hitting ```"=```

### q

q records things - so it doesn't do much on its own. You need to tell it what register to store the recorded sequence in.

```qa``` Begins recording into register a. Enter in keystrokes you want to save, then hit ```q``` to end the recording.

```@a``` Will play back what you just recorded into register a.

If you wanted to increment a set of numbers in a line of text like ```.icon-1 { background-image:url(img-1.png); }``` you could do
```qa0yyp/\d<CR><c-x>n<c-x>0q``` now if we run ```@a``` and our cursor is on the line with code we want incremented, it will copy that line
and bump both of those numbers up to 2. And if we run it again with ```@@``` it will increment all the twos to threes on a new line. Or we could give it a count with ```99@a``` and get all the numbers up to 100.

#### EX Commands

```:q``` quits file only if you have no unsaved changes

```:q!``` quits file without writing any of your changes

```:wq``` saves and quits file

```:12,42wq``` saves lines 12 to 42 and quits file

```:wqa``` saves and quits all files in buffer

### r
```r``` Replaces character under cursor with next input i.e.

```ra``` Replaces the character under the cursor with a.

```R``` Enter "replace mode" which is like insert mode except you will overwrite characters instead of insert between them.

#### EX Commands

```:r filename``` Read the contents of filename and place into the current buffer.

```:r !ls``` Pastes in the output of ls. ! calls an external process in vim. So this can be pretty userful

```:r !w3m -dump http://somewebsite.com``` Pastes in the content from somewebsite.com without any of the markup. Must have w3m installed. WHICH YOU SHOULD.

```:r !tree``` Pastes in the output from running tree on a directory.

### s

```s``` deletes the character your cursor is on and enters into insert mode

```S``` deletes the whole line you are on and enters into insert mode

#### EX Commands

s is how you do find and replace, so let's just say it is all of the important.

```:s/foo/bar``` replaces foo with bar on the current line for the first occurance of foo

```:12,42s/foo/bar``` replaces foo with bar on lines 12,42 for the first occurance of foo in each line

```:12,42s/foo/bar/g``` replaces all occurances of foo with bar on lines 12,42

```:tabdo %s/\ class=".*"//ge | update``` Delete all classes in markup for all files in the current tab.

```:%s/\s\+$//e``` Removes trailing whitespace

### t

```t``` means 'til' so it doesn't do anything on its own. It is very similar to f but f is inclusive. T is exclusive meaning it will stop before the character you are finding.

```tf``` put cursor one character before the next occurance of f

```;``` repeat latest f, F, t, or T

```,``` repeat it in the opposite direction

```dt<``` Delete up until the next ```<```. This is handy in the markup world.

```dt"``` Delete from cursor until next "

```dt}``` Delete from cursor until next }

### u

```x``` delete character under your cursor

```X``` this will delete a character before the cursor. Same as ```dh```

```:12,42d x``` This will delete lines 12,42 into register x

```"jY``` Copies current line into register j

```:12,112y``` Copies lines 12 through 112

```mk { motion } y'k``` Mark a spot k, navigate to a new spot and then copies from mark k to the current position of your cursor

```yt"``` Copies from current cursor postion to the next quote on the same line.

```yt>``` Copies from current cursor postion to the next > on the same line.

```yT>``` Copies from current cursor postion to the previous > on the same line.

```z-``` Redraws the screen so that your cursor line is at the bottom of the window
