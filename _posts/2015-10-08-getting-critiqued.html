title: "Getting Critiqued"

<p>
  As an art major in college, one of the regular parts of the process is having
  your peers critique your work in 3 hour long sessions that are creatively
  called ‘critiques.’ I quickly learned to dread them.
</p>
<p>
  At first, they were horrible. Here I was, attempting to translate all of
  the crazy stuff in my brain, heart, and soul into some physical medium
  that people could consume.
</p>
<p>
  As I am not / was not a great artist this was a
  very frustrating experience in general. I would walk into a critique
  with a varied mix of pride for some of the things I thought I did well and
  shame for the 200 thousand things I didn’t do well. Creatives are
  often times their own worst critics, but it generally doesn’t take the sting
  out of hearing what someone else has to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it’s something you’ve already thought about. Many, many, many times.
</p>
<p>
  The process generally went like this: You put up your work and then people
  critiqued it for 20-30 minutes. You never get to say anything. At all. No
  explanation of your process or what you were trying to accomplish. People just
  took what they saw and told you what they thought. As you might imagine, it was
  hard to work on something you cared about that much and then have people tear
  it apart. It’s hard not to feel like they are in some ways, tearing you apart.
  18-22 year old kids are often times not that great at structuring constructive
  feedback. But this in no way slows them down from telling you what is on their
  mind.
</p>
<p>
  Somewhere along the line, I don’t remember where really, I figured something out.
</p>
<p>
  I figured out that the Beatles are in no way my favorite band. I don’t even know if they are in my
  top 40 favorite musical acts. But I still think they might be the greatest band
  in the history of the world (so far.)
</p>
<p>
  I also figured out I know some people who don’t like the Beatles. At all.
  They think they make awful music. My parents happen to be two of these
  people.
</p>
<p>
  There are roughly 7.35 billion people on the planet. And if I sit back and
  think about it, I’m guessing I could find 100 million people who honestly
  believe that they Beatles are horrible. Just plain awful at making music.
</p>
<p>
  In truth, I could probably find more than 100 million. I wouldn’t be
  surprised if I could find 1 billion people who
  really loathe the sounds that the Beatles make.
</p>
<p>
  This became a liberating realization. I started to feel a lot more
  comfortable when people tore my work apart. Because I realized how I felt
  just didn’t matter. And what people said became more interesting. Some of it
  was good feedback that was well thought out. Some of it was bad feedback that
  wasn’t well thought out. But I came to appreciate it all. I also learned that
  giving thoughtful actionable feedback is a skill in and of itself that most people don't posess.
  So when you do find someone who has this skill, you should ask them for feedback all the time.
</p>
<p>
  Later in life, after graduating from school with a degree in getting my work torn apart, I became a designer.
</p>
<p>
  So I still sit through a lot of critiques of my work. Sometimes in the form
  of pull requests, sometimes in the form of in person meetings. Sometimes in
  the form of reading things on twitter or hacker news or reddit or some other
  website that has enabled posting stuff and making comments on it.
</p>
<p>
  These design critiques are easy now. When you are an artist I think it’s okay if your
  work isn’t about the user. For me art was always about process. And while I
  enjoyed people being able to consume it and maybe even getting something from
  it, making them feel something, really was never the goal.
</p>
<p>
  But design is different. As a designer, I don’t matter. My work doesn’t
  matter. Nothing I make matters in the context of my process.  It’s all about
  the people you are building for. You’re just trying to solve problems for
  people. Once you realize this, it’s the most liberating thing. Because every
  critique is valid. It doesn’t need to feel like your soul is being ripped
  apart. In the producing/consumption relationship - it is natural as a user to feel
  helpless. Like you have no power. The power is held by the people who build the products.
  This is a horrible feeling. And when people feel helpless, they often times give feedback
  that might seem harsh or mean. I think it's my job as a designer to be empathetic to this. And remember,
  it's not about me or the time I spent working on something.
</p>
<p>
  It’s not always easy to hear negative things about your work. This is a natural
  human reaction. But those moments where my heart skips a beat, or I feel a pang
  of hurt in my heart from someones insensitive words I meditate on the Beatles.
  And if they aren’t perfect and loved by all, how could I expect that of myself.
</p>
<p>
  None of our designs are likely to last forever. I can’t tell you how many
  things I’ve designed that don’t exist anymore. We’re just cogs in an
  evolutionary wheel , trying to make the world around us a little better. So don’t get too
  attached to any part of a design. Don’t fall in love with borders,
  gradients, a shade of blue, text on blurred photos, fancy animations, a certain
  typeface, flash, or music that autoplays. Just get
  attached to solving problems for people.
</p>
<p>
If you fall in love with that, critiques will become easy. Because
you’ll start to see every piece of feedback as a clue to making things better.
Some feedback will be bad and poorly thought out, some will be mean, some will be pure gold. And
it’s your job to try and distill the gold from the dirt. But remember, the
second you become a designer you have an obligation to not
make it about you. You have an obligation to make it about the people using what you design.
</p>
<p>
  These people might never thank you. They might never even think about you.
  But I still think it's the best job. And that it’s all worth it.
