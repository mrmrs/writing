    "IMMACULATE typography is certainly the most brittle of all the arts. To create
    a whole from many petrified, disconnected and given parts, to make this whole
    appear alive and of a piece — only sculpture in stone approaches the unyielding
    stiffness of perfect typography. For most people, even impeccable typography
    does not hold any particular aesthetic appeal. In its inaccessibility, it
    resembles great music. Under the best of circumstances, it is gratefully, accepted.
    To remain nameless and without specific appreciation, yet to have been of service
    to a valuable work and to the small number of visually sensitive readers — this, as
    a rule, is the only compensation for the long, and indeed neverending,
    indenture of the typographer.

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Form &amp; Variance</h2>
<p>
  The web is fluid. This should be considered when designing screens that are
  to be rendered by browsers. Last month people visited bluebottlecoffee.com using
  1,222 different screen sizes.  Building sites that are responsive is only one
  of the design considerations this introduces.  How do you build an interface
  that is well balanced across all screen sizes? How do you build these
  interfaces quickly? How do you build them to be readable? How to do you build
  them to be performant? How do you account for the unknown?
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Accounting for the Unknown</h2>
<p>
  Besides designing for an ever growing number of screensizes and resolutions we
  must also account for the settings a user picks for their browser. One of these
  settings is the base font-size. While this can't be detected with site analytics, it's
  estimated from user research studies that 10-12% of people set their default
  font-size to something other than 16px. So how do we build designs that scale
  proportionally and relatively for the myriad of combinations between devices and
  font-sizes that people choose to view the web on? How do we design components
  and interfaces to be harmonious with each other in the faces of so many unknowns?
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Proportions</h2>
<p>
  Using relative sizing units - we can ensure that measurements will remain
  proportional no matter what font-size a user has chosen. An explicit pixel
  value however - will not scale relative to a users settings. This leads to
  designs that may be responsive - but do not posess the desired visual harmony.
  Static comps with explicit pixel values are not reflective of
  the raw materials that make up the web.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Alignment</h2>
<p>
  The reality of front-end development is that people of varying skill
  levels will inherently touch your front-end code. This is not a bad thing, but
  it is a problem that requires design solutions. You must have a system in place
  that makes it easy for people to build well balanced interfaces with as little
  difficulty as possible. Not everyone will care about the quality of code, or
  how it renders to the browser. Not everyone will test the interface on a wide
  variety of devices with various font-size settings.
  The best solution I have seen so far is to use a defined system for people to
  work within, that doesn't make them think about things they don't want to think about.
  The result of this is that regardless of the interface you are working on -
  your components will all have the same sets of relative proportions and things will
  just magically line up without time lost to debugging or re-inventing the wheel.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">It's just text</h2>
<p>
  The web, is mostly text. People have been studying
  typography for centuries and we would be smart to leverage the findings of
  brilliant designers dedicated to this craft. Regardless of the medium - most
  great design is mathematically based. When designing around text, modular
  scales and attention to proportion is considered to be the start of a sound
  approach. Consider this exerpt from Tschichold's "Form of the Book":
</p>
<blockquote class="ph0 mh0">
<p class="i">
  The geometrically definable irrational page proportions like 1:1.618 (Golden
  Section), 1: V^2, 1: V^3, 1: V^5, 1:1.538, and the simple rational
  proportions of 1:2, 2:3,
  5:8 and 5:9 I call clear, intentional and definite. All others are unclear and
  accidental ratios. The difference between a clear and an unclear ratio, though
  frequently slight, is noticeable.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  While all of these scales would be a good starting point to use for creating a beautiful
  and harmonious design - all but one lead to sequences of non integer numbers. The 1:2 scale (powers
  of two) leads to a series of integers that browsers don't have difficulty
  rendering. While computers were largely invented to compute mathematical
  problems, browsers are notoriously horrible at math. They compute simple arithmetic equations
  and render values inconsistently. To avoid complicated and unsolvable
  debugging sessions where things don't line up - integers are the best route.
</p>
<p>
  These ratios are common patterns that can be seen in print, architecture and
  music so often it is hard to deny them as an elegant underlying order.
</p>

<p>
  Katsura Villa, a Japanese residence and temple is "founded on the unit of
  the tatami mat which measures 90:180cm" or a 1:2, powers of two ratio.
  "The aesthetics of this architecture lie in the beauty of its proportions and the materials used."
</p>

  <span class="ttu tracked gray f6"> Katsura Villa </span>
</div>

<p>
  A scale comprised of <b>5, 10, 20, 25, 30 etc. cannot be represented by a ratio</b>. They are ticks on a
  numberline not seen anywhere else in nature, print, architecture or music
  when studying cohesive design systems.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Why use 16 as a base?</h2>
<p>
  The default font-size for most browsers is 16px and this is no accident.  This
  is a font-size comparable to type in a book. While printed type is often
  smaller it's partly because books are often times held closer to the face then
  digital screens. While mobile phones and tablets are generally held at the same
  distance as books they are also used while moving more frequently - this
  movement affects the readability of word shapes and so 16px is generally the
  smallest type for content you want to serve up to a user.
</p>
<p>
  In this sample list of graphics display resolutions, you will notice that all
  of these numbers are divisible by 16, one exception that is not listed here is
  the SXGA+ graphics resolution that is not approved by any organization and was
  a break from the mold. It resulted in some weird graphics problems... but that is
  a different story for a different time.
</p>
<p>
  Granted not all browsers are used at full screen 100% of the time - but it's
  a good thing to consider when trying to create proportional designs that
  scale well. While we aren't print designers working within a fixed medium -
  there are consistencies in almost every graphics resolution which we can use
  to our advantage. It should be noted that these numbers are often times
  indivisible by 5 and only divisible by 10 50% of the time.

  While 5 and 10 are common units because we are (generally) born with ten digits
  on our hands - it seems more suitable to use 16 as a base measurement for this
  medium. Time in music is most commonly divided this way as well. 1/16, 1/8, 1/4
  1/2 and whole notes. These paralells are not a coincidence. Math and music are the
  sisters of design.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 ttu tracked mt4">Inclusive Design</h2>
<p>
  It's easy to fall into the trap of designing for one context. If you have working legs, you
  are not likely to notice that a building has been constructed with a long staircase that is
  not accessible to someone in a wheelchair. If you can't walk up stairs, you definitely notice.
  One of the core values I like to embrace when designing is 'being hospitable.'
</p>
<p>
  What does being hospitable look like on the web?  For me being hospitable means
  not making assumptions about our users and their capabilities.  I have better
  than 20/20 vision. When I first started out as a designer I used a lot of
  small font-sizes. I thought they looked aesthetically pleasing. I still do.
</p>
<p>
  But I'm not designing for myself. I'm trying to design for everyone. It
  should be considered that compared to a 20 year old's retina, the retina of a
  40 year old only receives about 50% of available light. An 80 year old retina
  only receives about 20%. So text set at lower font-sizes and/or low contrasts
  are actually impossible for some people to read. For reference, a quick scan
  of age demographics from my personal site analtyics reveals that 40%+ of
  people that visit my websites are above the age of 35.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Everyone can read large type.</b>  Not everyone can read small type. In a similar fasion:
  everyone can walk up a ramp, while only some people can walk up stairs. I think
  we should be welcoming to our web guests and cater to their accessibility needs
  because, well, it's the right thing to do. It's a frustrating experience to
  need to zoom in just to read text. So let's not make people do it.
