  When you declare line-height in css you don't need to declare a unit.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/line-height" title="CSS line-height spec">The line-height property defaults to being a multiplier relative to the font-size.</a> So a unitless line-height is equivalent to declaring
  the font-size times the number specified for line-height. i.e:<br>
  <code class="f5 pvxs phm mvxs" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 14</code> is equivalent to 14x the current font-size <br>
  or the em equivalent<br>
  <code class="f5 pvxs phm mvxs" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 14em</code>
</p>
<p>
  Since you don't need to provide a unit for line-height, I say just leave it off. Whatever you do, don't use pixels or percents. Ever. They are far too variable and abstract to determine the end result.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of whether or not you are writing a book, or making a website -
  you generally only need 3 or 4 values for line-height.
</p>
<h2 class="mbn">Solid </h2>
<code class="f5 pvxs mvxs phm" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1</code>
<p>
  When a line-height has a 1:1 ratio to the size of the type (line-height: 1)
  this is known as setting type solid. Most typefaces set at solid are
  unreadable - so this should be avoided in most cases.
</p>
<p>
  One reason to set line-height to 1 is for single lines of text that need to
  be set flush at the top with a corresponding element that has embedded media
  or a solid background. For example a piece of text next to an image where we
  want the top of the typographic element to be perfectly aligned at the top
  with the image.
</p>

<h2 class="mbn">Larger font sizes for titles </h2>
<code class="f5 pvxs mvxs phm" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1.2</code>
<p>Titles require less leading than body copy. You generally want something around 1.2-1.3.</p>

<h2 class="mbn">Body copy</h2>
<code class="f5 pvxs mvxs phm" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1.6</code>
<blockquote class="pln mln">

   "Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text
   when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2
   allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the
   previous one."

<p>
  I generally set copy to 1.6 to aid in readibility. But this becomes a matter
  of taste as any number set for line-height between this defined range will improve readability.
</p>

<h2>Improper uses of line-height</h2>

<p>Often times you see line-height applied with a pixel value as a unit for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To affect/set the height of an element.</li>
  <li>To vertically center text within an element.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Altering the height of an element should generally be done with a padding value
  selected from a ratio based scale that relates to your type scale.
</p>

<p>
  Using line-height to vertically center things is very brittle and only works
  when there is one line of text. E.g if you have a font-size of 24px and you
  set line-height to 48px to vertically center the text, if the copy wraps it
  will have 200% leading which will most likely look very awkward and should thus
  be avoided.
</p>
<p>
  Vertically centering elements should be done by setting vertical-align on an
  element that is set to display: table-cell. This element should be a child element of an element set to
  display: table. This is a pattern I will document with coding examples. The
  benefit being it works in more contexts and can be used to vertically center
  text elements against media objects across all breakpoints.
