   vertical distance from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next. Also
   called <b>leading</b>.

  When you declare line-height in css you don't need to declare a unit.
</p>
<p>
  The line-height property defaults to being relative to the font-size. So a unitless line-height is equivalent to declaring
  a percentage i.e:<br>
  <code class="f5 pv1 ph3 mv1 bg-lightest-blue">line-height: 140%</code> <br>
  or an em<br>
  <code class="f5 pv1 ph3 mv1 bg-lightest-blue">line-height: 1.4em</code>
</p>
<p>
  Since you don't need either. I say just leave it off. But whatever you do, don't use pixels.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of whether or not you are writing a book, or making a website -
  you generally only need 3 or 4 values for line-height.
</p>
<h2 class="mb0">Solid </h2>
<code class="f5 pv1 mv1 ph3" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1</code>
<p>
  When a line-height has a 1:1 ratio to the size of the type (line-height: 1)
  this is known as setting type solid. Most typefaces set at solid are
  unreadable - so this should be avoided in most cases.
</p>
<p>
  One reason to set line-height to 1 is for single lines of text that need to
  be set flush at the top with a corresponding element that has embedded media
  or a solid background. For example a piece of text next to an image where we
  want the top of the typographic element to be perfectly aligned at the top
  with the image.
</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Larger font sizes for titles </h2>
<code class="f5 pv1 mv1 ph3" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1.2 to 1.3</code>
<p>Titles require less leading than body copy. You generally want something around 1.2-1.3.</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Body copy</h2>
<code class="f5 pv1 mv1 ph3" style="background:#baecff;">line-height: 1.5 to 1.75</code>

  <p>
   Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text
   when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2
   allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the
   previous one.

  I generally set copy to 1.6 to aid in readibility. But this becomes a matter
  of taste between this defined range and is not generally an issue of
  readability.

<h2>Improper uses of line-height</h2>

<p>Often times you see line-height applied with a pixel values as a unit for one of the following reasons</p>

<ul>
  <li>Affecting/setting the height of an element</li>
  <li>Vertically centering text within an element</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Altering the height of an element should generally be done with a padding value
  selected from a ratio based scale that relates to your type scale.
</p>

<p>
  Using line-height to vertically center things is very brittle and only works
  when there is one line of text.  E.g if you have a font-size of 24px and you
  set line-height to 48px to vertically center the text, if the copy wraps it
  will have 200% leading which will most likely look very awkward and should thus
  be avoided
</p>
<p>
  Vertically centering elements should be done by setting vertical-align on an
  element set to display: table-cell that is contained within an element set to
  display: table.  This is a pattern I will document with coding examples. The
  benefit being it works in more contexts and can be used to vertically center
  text elements against media objects across all breakpoints.
