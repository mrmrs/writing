<p>
  I don't believe there is a magical silver-bullet list of books to read that
  will make you a great designer. There are a lot of books about how to get
  better at design. It becomes almost daunting. In my quest to become a better
  designer I have read a lot of books that were not very helpful. The following
  is a list of books that I have found to be invaluable. They are the books
  that I read over and over again. And while you shouldn't feel limited to what
  is on this list, if these are the only books you read... I think you'll be
  okay.
