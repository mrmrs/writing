  I don't believe there is no magical list of books to read that will make you 
  a great designer. There are a lot of books about how to get better at design. It becomes almost daunting. In my quest to become a better designer I have read a lot of books that were not very helpful. The following is a list of books that I have found to be invaluable. They are the books that I read over and over again. And while you shouldn't feel limited to what is on this list, if these are the only books you read... I think you'll be okay.
