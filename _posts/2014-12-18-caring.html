<p>
  Yes it does.
</p>
<p>
  It matters because performance matters in general. You might care about performance for different reasons, but I can’t think of a single reason you wouldn’t care at all.
</p>
<p>
  I care about performance because I think a users time is the most valuable thing and shouldn’t be wasted for any reason. You might care about performance because you want to make more money.
</p>
<p>
  I just think you should care.
