title: "What is CSS for?"

<p>
  HTML by itself is 100% responsive and 100% vector*. This is a simple but important point.
  And if it's correctly marked up with semantic tags, it's extremely readable on any device.
</p>
<p>
  This is out of the box functionality that we should stop messing up. If your CSS removes any 
  part of these features, you should rethink its purpose. If you solve a problem by creating 
  one or more problems, you are doing a bad job. 
  <br>
  <br>
  When you rasterize the web, <br>
  when you make it less readable,<br>
  when you make it less responsive <br> 
  - you create problems for your users. <br>
  <br>
  Stop doing that.
</p>
<p>
  CSS is not here to make our lives as developerseasy. It's here to enhance the usability of the web.  It's here to make the users life better. 

</p>
<p>When we write CSS, we should keep these points in mind.</p>
