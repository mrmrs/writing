  In 2011 Microsoft asked their customers to stop using IE6. Which, for the
  uninformed, is the sixth version of a web browser they created all by
  themselves. They built it, presumably, so that people could do stuff on the
  world wide web. This, is a marvelous thing!  It lets people read text, look
  at cat gifs, watch videos, fill out text inputs, select radio buttons, and
  submit forms.  Basically all the same stuff we use the internet for now.
</p>
<p>
  In 2015, enterprise software companies are still signing contracts to ensure
  that their software will support various versions of IE that Microsoft may or
  may not support themselves.  These deals are signed because a company decides
  that upgrading their OS / browser version is more costly than keeping things
  as they currently are. Maybe they have some custom software that relies on a
  particular browser version.  That software might run their business, solve
  their current problems, and would be costly to upgrade.
</p>
<p>
  I have been paid, to sit in meetings, just so I can
  participate in conversations debating which browsers we will or will not support.
  These meetings never fail to seem silly at best.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few assumptions about the benefits of restricting the amount of devices,
  browsers, and platforms to support when you are designing, developing, and
  maintaining software:
</p>
<ol class="pl0 measure lh-copy">
  <li>
    By limiting how many contexts you are building and designing for, you can
    build more features with greater speed. This seems good.
  </li>
  <li>
    By targeting the most widely used browsers and devices you will make the
    most amount money with the least amount of effort. This also seems good.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can build cooler/better/awesomer things if you don't have to support
    old technology. This seems absolutely fabulous.
  </li>
  <li>
    1% of people isn't enough to worry about. This seems horrible if you happen
    to be in that 1%.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let's pause for a second. This might be where you want to chime in about
  "evergreen" browsers. They just update themselves to the latest version so
  the problem is solved! We don't have legacy browsers to support anymore! They
  will automatically disappear!  Yet, I have three evergreen browsers installed
  on my computer.  And there are apps that I am required to use for my job that
  only work on one of those three browsers. Evergreen browsers have not solved
  this fundamental problem of making a business decision centered around
  choosing which browsers to support when building new features for your web
  app. Most likely, browsers themselves won't solve this problem any time soon.
  Historical data suggests that as time goes on, there will be more and more
  browsers. And more and more devices to run all of these browsers on. Which
  means that there will be an increasing amount of contextual differences to
  account for.
</p>
<p>
  Hooray.
</p>
<p>
  It doesn't matter what your stance on browser support is. Whether you want to
  think about it or not, the truth is, your decision affects people that are
  trying to use your product.
</p>
<p>
  Can you think of a time when you needed technology to solve a problem for
  you. In a timely manner. And you just wanted stuff to work. But it didn't.
  Because of decisions other people made. Decisions that were out of your
  control as a user.
</p>
<p>
  Was it frustrating?  Did you just assume you had an inferior browser and
  device and the software problem was your fault?  Was knowing that the company
  saved design and development time and chose to support a limited majority
  comforting?  Would you wish these feelings upon anyone else?
</p>

<p>
  This when I ask you to pause and reflect: Why did you start building technology in the first place?
  Was it to construct a sick portfolio to show off at dinner parties?
  Was it to build fancy animations?
  Was it so you could save yourself time and frustration at the expense of others time and frustration?
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you don't care about people's time or their feelings. Maybe you just
  care about money. And active users. I get that. You're running a business
  afterall. You have to make tough business decisions so you can make the big
  business bucks.  So you prepare for a meeting to talk about which browsers
  your company will support. You look at your current google analytics.  You
  notice there are a few browsers that make up around ~1% of your traffic. 1%
  sounds low.
</p>
<p>
  This is an easy trap to fall into. But there are a few things to consider.
  Browser metrics are self-fulfilling prophecies. If your website doesn't work
  on IE, you aren't going to get a lot of repeat IE users. Analytics data
  rewards what you support and penalizes what you don't. This will allow your
  developers and designers to justify that their current methods with analytics
  that show - there are browsers that don't matter. And they don't want to
  spend time supporting them.
</p>
<p>
  The second thing to consider is how percentages work.  1% sounds small. .5%
  sounds so small you shouldn't even think about thinking about it.  But if you
  run a business and care about how many people are using your product these
  are not small numbers.  As of 2015 there are more than 7 billion people on
  Earth. Now, not all of these people have access to the internet.  But 1% of 1
  billion is 10 million people.  It doesn't matter what size your company is.
  10 million potential users is a lot.  While internet usage is rapidly
  increasing - only ~40% of the population currently has access. So out of 2.8
  billion people if 1% are using an unsupported browser - you are chopping 28
  million potential users off the block before you get started.
</p>
<p>
  This could, potentially, be bad for your bottom line.
</p>
<p>
  I should give the disclaimer that not every website I build works on every
  browser and every device 100% bugfree with 0 errors.  It's a difficult
  thing to do!  But it's the standard I hold myself to. Because I'm
  interested in difficult tasks.  I won't bend on my mission to
  make the web as open and useful for as many people as possible.  And even if
  you are willing to compromise this standard, rest assured I'll still love
  you. But try to not forget about all the people sitting on the other side of
  the screen.
